---v1.59---
-Added UI fixes for MATLAB r2018b and Ubuntu 18
-Added new PsychToolboxAudio plugin, to improve on PsychToolboxSoundServer with an improved interface. PsychToolboxSoundServer is still supported.
-Updated PsychToolboxAudio and PsychToolboxSoundServer plugins to support HTOmega FENIX and ASUS Xonar AE sound cards 
-Updated PsychToolboxAudio and PsychToolboxSoundServer plugins to support WASAPI interface (ASIO is used by default if it is detected)
-Added implicit programming of serial messages, e.g. in OutputActions, {'MyModule', ['P' 4 2]} is now valid (though not if used with TrialManager)
-Changed saving option from -v6 to standard (this is actually faster in MATLAB r2018+ and similar in r2013-2018)
-Added notification and instructions if user has Xonar DX or DSX on Windows without ASIO
-Added echo module example firmware for Adafruit Metro M4 (for use with Bpod Arduino Shield)
-Updated GUI font to courier, removed font installation requirement
-Added preliminary interface to Champalimaud Hardware Platform's HARP sound card (note: this is an alpha release and has known issues)
-Changed timing precision of rotary encoder module (REM) from ms to us (requires REM firmware update to v5)
-Added plugin to interface with Pololu Maestro servo controller (can be used to trigger servo motors with soft codes)
-Added class for Ethernet module to act as a TCP server and relay incoming bytes from clients to state machine (requires Ethernet module firmware swap)
-Added support for sound calibration with NI USB-6211 and Bruel&Kjaer Nexus Condition amp + microphone (requires Data Acqusition Toolbox)

---v1.58---
-Added software to keep MATLAB software current: UpdateBpodSoftware(). Currently requires Win7 or Win10 with MATLAB r2014b+
-Added firmware update app to keep Bpod firmware current: UpdateBpodFirmware(). Currently requires Win7 or Win10.
-Fixed axes display in TrialTypeOutcomePlot plugin
-Minor optimization to AddState() function (now uses prepared vectors instead of ones() and zeros() to populate defaults)
-Removed drawnow() from update method of BpodParameterGUI to reduce inter-trial dead-time on MATLAB versions newer than r2014b
-Fixed a bug in TrialManager() that would cause crashes when state names varied between trials
-Disabled PhoneHome transmissions on boot and protocol-start (to resume once Sanworks has a 100% reliable web host)

---v1.57---
-Fixes to analog input module class (+matching fixes to its firmware repository), fix streaming to scope UI at sampling rates >1kHz

---v1.56---
-Updated current state machine firmware to v21 (optimizations for state machine r2)
-Added support for Bpod port array module
-Updated rotary encoder class with several bug-fixes, support for 8 thresholds and support for capturing + timestamping state machine byte codes
-Updated BControl patch to improve handling of laggy USB serial buffers on some systems

---v1.55---
-Fixed SSL handshake bug in PhoneHome program (CRITICAL)
-Enabled rotary encoder module to log and timestamp bytes from state machine
-Added 'unipolar' mode to rotary encoder module, for treadmill assays
-Restored display of automatically changing parameters in BpodParameterGUI
-Updated serial interface syntax used to relay Bonsai soft codes
-Updated BControl patch to handle pausing and sound server reset following a MATLAB force-quit

---v1.54---
-Added Ethernet Module support with PsychToolbox (previously req. Instrument Ctrl Tlbx)
-Added in-trial pause support to BControl patch
-In BControl patch, added ability to list channels in any order in settings_custom.conf
-In BControl patch, added ability to loop sounds on sound server (vs. looping sched. wave)
