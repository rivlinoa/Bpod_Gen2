---v1.58---
-Added software to keep MATLAB software current: UpdateBpodSoftware(). Currently requires Win7 or Win10 with MATLAB r2014b+
-Added firmware update app to keep Bpod firmware current: UpdateBpodFirmware(). Currently requires Win7 or Win10.
-Fixed axes display in TrialTypeOutcomePlot plugin
-Minor optimization to AddState() function (now uses prepared vectors instead of ones() and zeros() to populate defaults)
-Removed drawnow() from update method of BpodParameterGUI to reduce inter-trial dead-time on MATLAB versions newer than r2014b
-Fixed a bug in TrialManager() that would cause crashes when state names varied between trials
-Disabled PhoneHome transmissions on boot and protocol-start (to resume once Sanworks has a 100% reliable web host)

---v1.57---
-Fixes to analog input module class (+matching fixes to its firmware repository), fix streaming to scope UI at sampling rates >1kHz

---v1.56---
-Updated current state machine firmware to v21 (optimizations for state machine r2)
-Added support for Bpod port array module
-Updated rotary encoder class with several bug-fixes, support for 8 thresholds and support for capturing + timestamping state machine byte codes
-Updated BControl patch to improve handling of laggy USB serial buffers on some systems

---v1.55---
-Fixed SSL handshake bug in PhoneHome program (CRITICAL)
-Enabled rotary encoder module to log and timestamp bytes from state machine
-Added 'unipolar' mode to rotary encoder module, for treadmill assays
-Restored display of automatically changing parameters in BpodParameterGUI
-Updated serial interface syntax used to relay Bonsai soft codes
-Updated BControl patch to handle pausing and sound server reset following a MATLAB force-quit

---v1.54---
-Added Ethernet Module support with PsychToolbox (previously req. Instrument Ctrl Tlbx)
-Added in-trial pause support to BControl patch
-In BControl patch, added ability to list channels in any order in settings_custom.conf
-In BControl patch, added ability to loop sounds on sound server (vs. looping sched. wave)
